  Base class that allows you to set up Inventory items of different classes that add their
  amounts up in a single inventory item, just like ammunition.  

  Lots of code derived from existing code in the Ammo class...  So much so that it's almost not
  worth it.  All you have to do to emulate this behavior is to inherit from Ammo instead of 
  Inventory and add "Ammo.BackpackAmount 0;" and "+INVENTORY.IGNORESKILL" to your base class.
