^c00You stand over the guard's body, grabbing frantically for his gun. You're not sure if the other guards heard his muffled scream.  Deep in the belly of a Nazi dungeon, you've only a knife, a gun, and your wits to aid your escape.
^PAGE 4
^G16,16,4
^c00Just a few weeks ago you were on a reconnaissance mission of extreme importance.  You were to infiltrate the Nazi fortress and find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust.  Captured in your attempt, you were taken to their prison, and awaited your execution.  Only you know where the plans are kept, and the Allies will face a great defeat if you don't escape!  You must face the horrors of the prison keep known as Wolfenstein.
^PAGE 5
^G16,16,11
Captain William J. "B.J." Blazkowicz, you've got a gun and eight floors of hell to get through.  Good luck!




Hey, if you make it, you'll have something to tell your grandkids about . . . .

If you don't, at least you'll go out in a blaze of glory!

^c7eCONTROLS
^c00
In Wolfenstein 3-D, you can use the keyboard, mouse, joystick, or Gravis PC Gamepad.
 
To move around the menus, use the arrow keys to move from item to item, then press ^c6eEnter ^c00to select that item.  ^c6eEsc ^c00always backs out.  You can press the first letter of a menu item to go to that item.

Or use the mouse, joystick, or Gamepad-- they work, too!
^PAGE 7
^G20,16,5
Once you are in the game, use the arrow keys to move. Hold down ^c6eShift ^c00to run fast.

Press ^c6eCtrl ^c00to fire your weapon.

Use ^c6eAlt ^c00 with the left and right arrows to slide side to side instead of turning left or right.  This is called "Strafe Mode."

Press ^c6eSpace ^c00to Open Doors and activate elevators to go to the next floor of the keep.
^PAGE 8
^G16,16,6
When using the mouse or joystick, use button 1 to shoot, button 2 to strafe.



With a three-button mouse, use the third button to open doors.

Gravis PC Gamepads have a fourth button, useful as a run button.
^PAGE 9
^G50,110,12
Once you have more than one weapon, the keys 1-4 choose the weapons:








Holding down the fire button is fun, but short bursts save bullets.
^PAGE 10
^G74,16,10
^G124,8,7
Some walls in the prison can be pushed back to reveal hidden rooms. Hold down Space to push the wall in front of you. Just think of Space as the Use key. It will use doors, use elevators, and so on.

There are locked doors in the castle that require either a gold or silver key.  It will be somewhere on the floor you're on.

If you find your health dropping, pick up some food or first aid.  You'll find you're damaged more when shot at close range.
^PAGE 11
^G16,16,9
Pick up the ammo left behind when you toast someone.  For instance, perforate an SS--free machine gun!


You get a free guy every 40,000 points, so collect those treasures! (You can have a maximum of nine lives.)

When you get killed, you lose everything but your gun and start at the beginning of the floor you were on.

^c7eABOUT ^c6eId ^c7eSOFTWARE
^c00
Yes, that's Id, as in the id, ego, and superego in the psyche.  We think shareware is a fine alternative to the high prices of commercial vendors.  For under twelve dollars a game, you can get the hottest, fastest texture-mapped game available.  How can you beat that?

^c2cWe'll answer that question in a few months. . . .

^c7eA FRIENDLY REMINDER

^c00Episode One is shareware.  The other five episodes are not: they are only available from Apogee or authorized dealers.  Please do not distribute episodes two through six.  It's easy to do, but the next game will just cost more if you do it.

Please report any illegal selling and distribution of this game to Apogee by calling 1-800-GAME123.  Or call the SPA Piracy Hotline: 1-800-388-PIR8.
