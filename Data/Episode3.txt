The absolute incarnation of evil, Adolf Hitler, lies at your feet in a pool of his own blood.  His wrinkled, crimson- splattered visage still strains, a jagged- toothed rictus trying to cry out.  Insane even in death.  Your lips pinched in bitter victory, you kick his head off his remains and spit on his corpse.

Sieg heil . . . huh.  Sieg hell.
