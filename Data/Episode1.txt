You run out of the castle and hook up with the Underground.  They inform you that the rumors were true: some hideous human experiments were seen around Castle Hollehammer. So Operation Eisenfaust is real!

You must journey there and terminate the maniacal Dr. Schabbs before his undead army marches against humanity!
